# Optional - Visualizing Big Data

This is a supplemental section to Chapter 3 Visualization. 

## Goal:

In this tutorial, we will combine what we have learned in the last two chapters, databases and visualization skills.  We will develop strategies for working with subsets of large data sets that are more manageable by visualization software so we can greate graphs and charts based on large data sets.
