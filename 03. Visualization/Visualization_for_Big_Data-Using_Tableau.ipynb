    "Tableau is a data analysis visualization software that is easy to learn and very easy to use. The software allows you to connect your data and perform queries without writing a single line of code. It allows you to shift between views with drag and drop technology to build anything from single visualizations to a interactive dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've successfully connected Tableau to the Big Data for Social Science server, you can easily create visualizations to display, navigate and understand the data available to you. These are a few short exercises that will teach you the basics of navigating the Tableau software so you can create your own visuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selecting Data Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "- Back to the [Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by selecting a table. Under the tab \"Database\" click on the dropdown menu and select \"homework\". Two tables will appear: OSU_grant and OSU_vendor (these are the same tables from the Database Basics notebook). \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, drag OSU_vendor to the section on the screen that says \"Drag tables here\" then choose \"Automatically Update\". If successful, you should see the data at the bottom of the screen. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now you are ready to create some visualizations!!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Notes about Selecting Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Back to the [Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some additional things to consider about our data before you jump into visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When combining tables in Tableau, the order datasets are added to Tableau dictates how you JOIN any two tables.  The type of JOIN you use tells Tableau how to combine the JOINed data sets, and if you choose the wrong JOIN type, you'll end up with bad data (usually either incomplete or with massive duplication).  A way to figure out which type of JOIN to use for simple data sets: decide which table you want to be the master table, from which all rows should be represented in your data set, then set Tableau to join on the side of that table.  For example, if you are joining OSU_grant and OSU_vendor, there are multiple vendors per grant, but only one grant per vendor.  In your data set, if you want to include all vendor expenditures, and then make sure related grant information is associated with each expenditure record, OSU_vendor is your master table, and so you'd join based on where OSU_vendor is in relation to OSU_grant in the Tableau \"Drag Tables here\" window - \"LEFT JOIN\" if you OSU_vendor is on the left side of OSU_grant, or \"RIGHT JOIN\" if OSU_vendor is on the right side.  You also need to set the appropriate JOIN columns, as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - For more details on JOINing OSU_vendor and OSU_grant, see below: [Combining Tables in Tableau - JOINs](#Combining-Tables-in-Tableau---JOINs)\n",
    "    - For more information on database table JOINs in general, see: [http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/33052/Visual-Representation-of-SQL-Joins](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/33052/Visual-Representation-of-SQL-Joins)<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Before beginning to work with a dataset, check to make sure that the variable types are consistent to the types of visualizations you want to show. For example, all dates should be a \"Date\" type and all numeric variables should be a numeric type. If you forget, you can always change the variable types while building your visualizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the OSU datasets, the \"Fipscode\" variable is automatically reported as a string variable. For these exercises, you will need to give them a \"Geographic Role\" of county type. To do this, click \"Abc\" below the variable header \"Fipscode\". Select \"Geographic Role\" and then select \"County\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Layout of a worksheet\n",
    "\n",
    "A Tableau worksheet is broken out into a few key areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- On the left is a vertical pane that contains \"Data\" and \"Analytics\" tabs.  To start, we'll refer to this as the Data pane.  The Data pane has two sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **Dimensions** - variables from your data set that contain non-numeric data such as strings, dates, or geographic identifiers.\n",
    "    - **Measures** - variables from your data set that are numeric.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- To the right of the Data Pane is the visualization area.  The visualization area is broken out into:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - a column of small windows called \"Cards\" that stack up on the left side of the visualization area, just to the right of the Data pane.\n",
    "    - \"Columns\" and \"Rows\" \"Shelves\" that span across the top of the area, and where you can drag and drop dimensions or measures to add them as rows or columns to the current visualization.\n",
    "    - the visualization area itself. which takes up the rest of the space to the right of the \"cards\" and under the \"shelves\".\n",
    "    \n",
    "- In the upper right corner of the screen by default, there is also a \"Show Me\" tab which expands to a window when clicked.  This window contains a set of available styles of visualizations that can be generated by Tableau, with those that can be applied to currently selected data highlighted and those that can not grayed out.\n",

    "- To choose the way the data from the two tables is \"JOIN\"ed, click on the Venn diagram (the two overlapping circles between and connected to the two datasets) between the two tables.\n",
    "- In the pop-up window that results, JOIN on the side of OSU_vendor (should be \"Left\").\n",
    "- Then, choose the column on which the two tables will be JOINed.  Beneath the options for JOIN types (\"Inner\", \"Left\", \"Right\", \"Outer\"), there will be a table in which join clauses are specified.  In the first row:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - On the left, in the \"Data Source\" column, select \"Uniqueawardnumber\" from the dropdown (\"Agency\" will likely be selected by default, so you'll be changing that).\n",
    "    - Leave the column in the middle set to \"=\" (you can change the operator here to test if a row in one table should be associated with another, which is advanced).\n",
    "    - In the right column, labeled \"OSU_vendor\", click on the dropdown menu and choose \"Uniqueawardnumber (OSU_vendor)\".\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Once you've specified the JOIN criterai, a complete dataset will appear below where each row from OSU_vendor contains the information on its associated grant from OSU_grant.  Grant information is now appended to the end of any row where the OSU_vendor record's \"Uniqueawardnumber\" value matched a given grant's \"Uniqueawardnumber\".  This allows you to include information on grants in your visualization.\n",
