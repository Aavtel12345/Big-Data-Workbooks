    "Tableau is a data analysis visualization software that is easy to learn and very easy to use. The software allows you to connect your data and perform queries without writing a single line of code. It allows you to shift between views with drag and drop technology to build anything from single visualizations to a interactive dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've successfully connected Tableau to the Big Data for Social Science server, you can easily create visualizations to display, navigate and understand the data available to you. These are a few short exercises that will teach you the basics of navigating the Tableau software so you can create your own visuals. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selecting Data Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "- Back to the [Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by selecting a table. Under \"Database\" click on the dropdown menu and select \"homework\". Two tables will appear: OSU_grant and OSU_vendor (these are the same tables from the Database Basics notebook). \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, draft OSU_vendor to the section on the screen that says \"Drag tables here\" then choose \"Automatically Update\". If successful, you should see the data at the bottom of the screen. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, drag the OSU_grant table toward the OSU_vendor table (top part of screen). Click on the Venn diagram between the two datasets and choose \"LEFT JOIN\". Clikc on the dropdown menu between \"Data Source\" and \"OSU_vendor\" and choose \"UNIQUEAWARDNUMBER\". A complete dataset will appear below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now you are ready to create some visualizations!!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Notes about Selecting Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Back to the [Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The order of joining the two datasets is very important and can affect the MySQL joins in you data. For example, if you choose to drag OSU_grant first in the example above, you will need to choose \"RIGHT JOIN\" instead of \"LEFT JOIN\" to make sure you have a complete dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Before beginning to work with a dataset, check to make sure that the variable types are consistent to the types of visualizations you want to show. For example, all dates should be a \"Date\" type and all numeric variables should be a \"numeric\" type. If you forget, you can always change the variable types while building your visualizations. \n",
    "\n",
    "3) In the OSU datasets, the \"FIPSCODE\" variable is automatically reported as a string variable. For these exercises, you will need to give them a \"Geographic Role\" of county type. \n",

    "- Click on \"Sheet 1\" (bottom left side of the screen) to start a worksheet\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are at a new worksheet, you can do the following: \n",
    "- From the Measures section (bottom left side of the screen), drag \"Payment Amount\" measures to the \"Rows Shelf\"\n",
    "- From the Dimensions section (top left side of the screen), drag \"Agency\" (from OSU_grant) to the \"Columns Shelf\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you can also click on the \"Payment Amount\" measure while holding the \"Control\" key, click on the \"Agency\" variable under Dimensions. Then, go to the \"Show Me\" menu (top right side of the screen). There you can see different graphs that are allowed with the selected variables. \n",

    "### Exercise 2: Create a Simple Timeline Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "- Back to the [Table of Contents](#Table-of-Contents)\n",

    "Once you are at a new worksheet, you can do the following: \n",
    "- From the Meaures section, drag \"Payment Amount\" measures to the \"Columns Shelf\"\n",
    "- From the Dimensions section, drag \"Period End Date\"\n",
    "- If you click on the [+] on Year(Periodenddate) Rows Shelf, you can add quarterly information to the total paymentamount\n",

    "- From the Dimensions section, click on \"FIPSCODE\" and then click \"SHOW ME\" to see the list of allowed charts\n",
    "- From Show Me, choose the second map (you can drag the map to change its position on the screen)\n",
    "- From the Dimensions section, drag \"Agency\" (OSU grant) to Color on Marks card\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives you a good visualization of the distribution of different categories of agency by county. The agency (OSU grant) card shows you what each color represents. \n",
