    "A relational database stores information in data files named **_tables_**.  Each **_table_** contains a pre-defined set of fields, called **_columns_**.  In a table, individual records are called **_rows_**, and in a given row, there will be one value for each **_column_**, sometimes called a **_cell_**.  Each row in a given table should have a **_key_** or ID, and when information in one table is related to information in another, in the most basic relational form, the two are linked by one of the rows storing the ID of the related row in a **_foreign key_** column as part of its data.  When you want to bring related data together in a relational database, you use the **_SQL_** querying language to filter and join together data across tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "A no-sql database treats data differently, and at this point, that is about all you can say that is common to all the different data storage systems that call them selves \"no-sql\".  no-sql databases are usually not inherently relational, though some are.  They used to not support SQL, but some have started to.  They tend to store data in more of a record- or document-centric model, where all data is stored in a homogenous pool of records, and the contents of a record are not formally defined.  In this model, some records are made up of name-value pairs (you are responsible for making sure records of a certain type have the same information).  Some hold \"documents\" that can contain substantially different formats (XML, JSON, plain text, PDF files, etc.).  Graph databases, which model network data, use the name-value pair container model, but have two types of records - nodes and ties.  Most grew up around the performance needs of web-based information systems that need to perform on a massive scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how do you choose?  The key is understanding your data, understanding what your needs are, and then understanding what a given database system gives you.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you really do have a set of documents and you just want to filter based on the text within, a document-based database might be the way to go (or just storing things on the file system and using command line tools...).\n",
    "- If you just have basic flat data (answers from a single set of survey questions for lots and lots of people), a database of name-value pair records might suffice.\n",
    "- If you have complex data made up of information on different distinct and interrelated entities, and you are interested in exploring the relationships, you probably should use a relational database where you can explicitly model your data and its relations (twitter data, plus a survey, plus facebook data and reddit posts, for example)."

The first uses the \"csv\" package to read in the twitter sample data file line by line and INSERT each line's contents as a row in the database.

It also loads the entire data file into memory when it reads the CSV file, and some of its choices for column types in sqlite are a little weird - there were no decimal places in any of the numbers, but some of them are type float in the database it generated for me, for example.\n",

    "Growth in complexity as it relates to adding code/data/transformations/analysis steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear - the dream, complexity never grows in a linear relationship with amount of code with a slope near 1.\n",
    "- Multiplicative - linear with slope of 2, 3, 4, etc. this is what adding code looks like at first\n",
    "- Exponential - as a program gets bigger, this is how complexity relates if you don't design, plan, etc.  it starts out being simpler to just fold new things in, but after a while, very hard to manage.\n",
    "- Logarithmic - this is what real programming looks like - if you abstract as you encounter things that should be abstracted, there is some additional complexity early, but over time, complexity is more manageable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the normalization might seem like a little much if you have relatively simple data from one source.  As soon as you start deriving time series data, or deriving social network data, then start to tie data sets together to people or places, your data starts to get complicated.  Carefully designing and normalizing your data is one way to manage this complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, don't feel you need to become an expert on every library and every analysis software package and every computer language ever.  Pick a few tools that you enjoy using and that make sense to you, learn those well, and use your core tools whenever you can.  For example, I am proficient at SQL, but I don't enjoy how it works.  I tend to use SQL to move data around, then use Python or another language to actually work with the data.  pandas is a great tool for this way of thinking - it helps to get data from one format to another, so you can use it in a system you are comfortable with."
