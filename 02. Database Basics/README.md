2. Basic SELECT and WHERE statements
3. Basic JOIN and subquery statements

Data necessary for this chapter:

Accompanying this chapter includes a set of CSV files to build the database that will be used as an example dataset for this chapter. Data files include: 

1. nsf_award.csv
2. nsf_investigator.csv

For subsequent chapters, there is a mysql dump file and "how to install" directions available in the Introduction folder.
