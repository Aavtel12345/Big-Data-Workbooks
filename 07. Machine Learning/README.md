1. Data needed: NSF grants that have already been topic modeled.
2. Exercise 1 will focus on classifying the departments of grants using a multinomial logit and will calculate metrics of model performance.
3. Exercise 2 will focus on a host of classification supervised techniques including SVM, Random Forests, Naive Bayes, and perform model selection using cross validation.
4. Exercise 3 will use unsupervised learning techniques (k means clustering) to the same problem and compare with supervised methods.
