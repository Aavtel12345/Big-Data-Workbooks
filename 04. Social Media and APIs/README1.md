We will be working with two APIs, PLOS and Twitter. 
Exercise 1 will focus on obtaining an API key for both PLOS and Twitter and testing it to get a 200 HTTP response status. 



Exercise 2 - Retrieve Article Level Metrics Data from the PLOS ALM API for the last three nobel laureates at Caltech, Eric Betzig, Martin Karplus & Robert H. Grubbs
Obtain a list of DOIs for their papers.
Use the DOIs to get Article Level Metrics Data.
Identify the top five articles that have the most tweets.
