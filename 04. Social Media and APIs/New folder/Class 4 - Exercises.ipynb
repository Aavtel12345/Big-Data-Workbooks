The application can be found at http://alm.labs.crossref.org/docs/Home. If your PI does not publish with PLOS you may find some interesting ALM data from this service. \n",

      "    2. Look at the [pyalm code on github](http://github.com/cameronneylon/pyalm) and the Practical Notes to identify how you need to add both the url for this API and your api key to use this instance.\n",
      "    3. Pull ALM data for articles of interest from this API, examine what is available and what information it provides\n",
      "2. Identify a set of user accounts that showed interest in a specific paper and obtain the text of their recent tweets. Consider the balance of scholarly vs non-scholarly activity and discuss how this text corpus might be used for topic modelling or machine learning that could inform a discussion of who these users are and what their influence is. Use either the python-twitter API wrapper or conduct your study manually. Consider the limitations of both approaches in terms of the precision and recall of your data gathering.\n",
      "3. Identify other relevant Web APIs and sources of data tha are of value in tracking the impact of research outputs. How interoperable are these various services? How well do they contribute to the overall ecosystem of data and services that support the monitoring and analysis of research? \n",
      "\n",
      "Examine and critique the (most unstructured) data you have collected in terms of its usability and quality. Consider how this data can or can not be processed and incorporated into the larger dataset that you are using throughout this course. What challenges exist in normalisation, quality assurance and schema management in incorporating this data into a monitoring effort on a large scale. Discuss the role of unique persistable identifiers such as DOIs in resolving the potential normalisation and de-duplication issues and identify gaps in the current identifier ecosystem that would need to be filled for data aggregation to work at scale."
