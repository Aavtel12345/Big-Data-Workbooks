    "## Programming Against an API using Crossref as an Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming against an API involves constructing HTTP requests and parsing the data that is returned. In this simple example we will use the Crossref API. Crossref is the provider of Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) used by many publishers to uniquely and persistably identify scholarly works. Crossref is not the only organisation to provide DOIs. In the scholarly communication space DataCite is another important provider. The Crossref API also provides metadata for DOIs provided by DataCite so is a useful source of data on many scholarly works. The documentation is available at http://api.crossref.org.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `requests` python library provides a series of convenience functions that make it easier to make HTTP calls and to process returned JSON. Requests is included within the standard IPython package and is easy to install if not available. Our first step is to import the module and set a base URL variable."
