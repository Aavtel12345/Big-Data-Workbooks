    "ORCID is a service that provides unique identifiers for researchers. Researchers can claim an ORCID profile and populate it with references to their research works, funding and affiliations. ORCID provides an API for interacting with this information. For many APIs there is a convenient Python wrapper that can be used. The `orcid-python` wrapper works with the ORCID v1.2 API to make various API calls straightforward. This only works with the public ORCID API and can therefore only access publicly available data.\n",

Each publication in the list has its own attributes which can then be examined individually. In this case the external IDs attribute is a list of further objects that in this case include a DOI and the ISSN of the journal this article was published in."

    "Wrappers generally make operating with an API simpler and cleaner by abstracting away the details of making HTTP requests. Achieving the same by directing interacting with the ORCID API would require constructing the appropriate URLs and parsing the returned data into a useable form. Where a wrapper is available it is generally much easier to use. However wrappers may not be actively developed and may lag the development of the API. Where possible use a wrapper that is directly supported or recommended by the API provider"
