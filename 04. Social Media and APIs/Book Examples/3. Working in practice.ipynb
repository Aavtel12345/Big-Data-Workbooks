    "\n",
    "It is common to work across multiple data sources to gather information. A very common pattern is to to search in one location to create a list of identifiers and then use those identifiers to query another API. In the ORCID example above we created a list of DOIs from a single ORCID profile. We could use those DOIs to obtain further information from the Crossref API and other sources. This models a common path for analysis of research outputs: identifying a corpus and then seeking information on its performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example we will build on the ORCID and Crossref examples to collect a set of work identifiers from an ORCID profile and use a range of APIs to identify additional metadata as well as information on the performance of those articles. In addition to the ORCID API we will use the PLOS Lagotto API. Lagotto is the software that was built to support the Article Level Metrics program at PLOS, the Open Access publisher, and its API provides information on various metrics of PLOS articles. A range of other publishers and service providers, including Crossref also provide an instance of this API meaning the same tools can be used to collect information on articles from a range of sources."
