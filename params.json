{"name":"BIG DATA AND SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH: THEORY AND PRACTICAL APPROACHES","tagline":"","body":"\r\n“The first big breakthrough in our understanding of the mechanism of association was an improvement in a method of measurement” Daniel Kahneman, 2011 Thinking Fast and Slow (p52)\r\n\r\nGOAL\r\n---------\r\n\r\nThe goal of the book is to bring computer scientists and social scientists together to provide a practically oriented overview of the analytical and statistical tools associated with big data for social science students. We use real data used for real world policy problems to analyze some of the vast new sets of data on human beings. We show them how these data can be collected, integrated, and analyzed in a scientific fashion.\r\n\r\nDRAFT BOOK OUTLINE\r\n---------\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 1: Introduction and Motivation\r\n[link](http://cssip.org/docs/publications/chapter1.pdf)\r\n<br>Authors: Julia Lane and Frauke Kreuter\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2: Databases and Database Management Systems\r\n[link](http://cssip.org/docs/publications/chapter2_20150909_pascal.pdf)\r\n<br>Authors: Juliana Freire and Pascal Heus\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3: Information Visualization\r\n[link] (http://cssip.org/docs/publications/chapter3.pdf)\r\n<br>Authors: Catherine Plaisant and Adil Yalcin\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4: Working with Web Data and APIs\r\n[link] (http://cssip.org/docs/publications/chapter4.pdf)\r\n<br>Author: Cameron Neylon\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5: Programming with Big Data\r\n[link] (http://cssip.org/docs/publications/chapter5.pdf)\r\n<br>Authors: Claudio Silva, Huy Vo and Pascal Heus\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6: Networks, the Basics\r\n[link] (http://cssip.org/docs/publications/chapter6.pdf)\r\n<br>Author: Jason Owen-Smith\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7: Introduction to Record Linkage\r\n[link] (http://cssip.org/docs/publications/chapter7.pdf)\r\n<br>Authors: Joshua Tokle and Stefan Bender\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8: Machine Learning\r\n[link] (http://cssip.org/docs/publications/chapter8.pdf)\r\n<br>Author: Rayid Ghani\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9: Text Analysis\r\n[link] (http://cssip.org/docs/publications/chapter9.pdf)\r\n<br>Authors: Evgeny Klochikhin and Jordan Boyd-Graber\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10: Errors in Big Data and Their Effects on Statistical Inference\r\n[link] (http://cssip.org/docs/publications/chapter10.pdf)\r\n<br>Author: Paul P.
